        <h2>Escape Civilization</h2>
        <p>
Aroostook, named from a Native American word meaning “Beautiful River” is aptly nicknamed the “The Crown of Maine” partly because of its geographic location but more because of the breathtaking experiences that await you. Known by several different names, including, “The Last Frontier of the East” or by many Mainers as just “The County,” Northern Maine instills memories that not even time can fade.

Bordering the provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick, geographically it is the largest county east of the Mississippi and in fact is larger than the States of Rhode Island and Connecticut combined.</p>
